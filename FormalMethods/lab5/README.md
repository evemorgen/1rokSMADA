Cool stuff:
  - hierarchy is about replacing subnet with one transition
  - subnets always connect with transition
  - hierarchy (subnet) connects with "sockets" 
  - in hierarchy we need to define "port" that socket corresponds to
 
Hierarchy - How it works:
  - to create group chose tool from "view"
  - to create hierarchy from this group click on first button from "Hierarchy" menu

Examples:
  - [Example 1 - create hierarchy from group](example1.cpn)
  - [Example 2 - simple protocol](simple-protocol.cpn)
  - [Example 3 - ???](example2.cpn)

Exercises:
  - [Exc 1. Change data types to use record instead of product](simple-protocol-record.cpn)
  - [Exc 2. Change data types to use union instead of record (one tyoe to rule them all)](simple-protocol-union.cpn)
