# LAB 5. Parallel Algorithms

Implement the algorithm which computes in parallel a matrix product of N  matrices:

where matrix sizes are given inside square brackets. The main task (T) i.e.,  multiplication of matrices, has to be split into subtask (T1,T2,â€¦Tm) to be proceeded in parallel. For example:

After completing T1,T2,T3, the algorithm proceeds with the main task, T.
