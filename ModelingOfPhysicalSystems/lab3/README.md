Important stuff:
  - B = 5x5cm
  - A = 20cm
  - TODO: calculate time to stabilize system  - TODO: find relationship between time resolution and oscylation

Report guidelines:
  - present aim
  - describe methodology
  - show both boundary conditions
  - check if model is stable in numerical sense
  - define criteria for steady state and time to obtain it
  - describe something, don't know what :P
  - show difference temp increase for theory model and actual model
  - show difference for plate with and without enviorment
