#Solutions:

## Part 1
1. Run R studio  
`mhm..`
2. Set your working directory using the setwd() command  
`comeon..`
3. Download, extract and open .csv file using ...
```
> download.file("http://home.agh.edu.pl/~mmd/_media/dydaktyka/as-is/car-speeds.csv.zip", "car-speeds.csv.zip")

> unzip("./car-speeds.csv.zip")
> carSpeeds <- read.csv(file='car-speeds.csv')
> head(carSpeeds)
  Color Speed     State
1  Blue    32 NewMexico
2   Red    45   Arizona
3  Blue    35  Colorado
4 White    34   Arizona
5   Red    25   Arizona
6  Blue    41   Arizona
```

4. Replace 'Blue' color with 'Green' in the $Color column using ifelse function.  
before:
```
> carSpeeds$Color
  [1] Blue   Red  Blue  White Red   Blue  Blue  Black White Red   Red   White
 [13] Blue  Blue  Black Red   Blue  Blue  White Blue  Blue  Blue  Red   Blue
 [25] Red   Red   Red   Red   White Blue  Red   White Black Red   Black Black
 [37] Blue  Red   Black Red   Black Black Red   Red   White Black Blue  Red
 [49] Red   Black Black Red   White Red   Blue  Blue  Black Blue  White Black
 [61] Red   Blue  Blue  White Black Red   Red   Black Blue  White Blue  Red
 [73] White White Blue  Blue  Blue  Blue  Blue  White Black Blue  White Black
 [85] Black Red   Red   White White White White Red   Red   Red   White Black
 [97] White Black Black White
Levels:  Red Black Blue Red White
```
`> carSpeeds$Color <- ifelse(carSpeeds$Color=='Blue', 'Green', carSpeeds$Color)`
after:  
```
> carSpeeds$Color
  [1] "Green" "1"     "Green" "5"     "4"     "Green" "Green" "2"     "5"
 [10] "4"     "4"     "5"     "Green" "Green" "2"     "4"     "Green" "Green"
 [19] "5"     "Green" "Green" "Green" "4"     "Green" "4"     "4"     "4"
 [28] "4"     "5"     "Green" "4"     "5"     "2"     "4"     "2"     "2"
 [37] "Green" "4"     "2"     "4"     "2"     "2"     "4"     "4"     "5"
 [46] "2"     "Green" "4"     "4"     "2"     "2"     "4"     "5"     "4"
 [55] "Green" "Green" "2"     "Green" "5"     "2"     "4"     "Green" "Green"
 [64] "5"     "2"     "4"     "4"     "2"     "Green" "5"     "Green" "4"
 [73] "5"     "5"     "Green" "Green" "Green" "Green" "Green" "5"     "2"
 [82] "Green" "5"     "2"     "2"     "4"     "4"     "5"     "5"     "5"
 [91] "5"     "4"     "4"     "4"     "5"     "2"     "5"     "2"     "2"
[100] "5"
```

5. Load same dataset as before but with stringsAsFactors argument set to False. Then use ifelse as before
```
> carSpeeds <- read.csv(file='./car-speeds.csv', stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
> carSpeeds$Color <- ifelse(carSpeeds$Color=='Blue', 'Green', carSpeeds$Color)
> carSpeeds$Color
  [1] "Green" " Red"  "Green" "White" "Red"   "Green" "Green" "Black" "White"
 [10] "Red"   "Red"   "White" "Green" "Green" "Black" "Red"   "Green" "Green"
 [19] "White" "Green" "Green" "Green" "Red"   "Green" "Red"   "Red"   "Red"
 [28] "Red"   "White" "Green" "Red"   "White" "Black" "Red"   "Black" "Black"
 [37] "Green" "Red"   "Black" "Red"   "Black" "Black" "Red"   "Red"   "White"
 [46] "Black" "Green" "Red"   "Red"   "Black" "Black" "Red"   "White" "Red"
 [55] "Green" "Green" "Black" "Green" "White" "Black" "Red"   "Green" "Green"
 [64] "White" "Black" "Red"   "Red"   "Black" "Green" "White" "Green" "Red"
 [73] "White" "White" "Green" "Green" "Green" "Green" "Green" "White" "Black"
 [82] "Green" "White" "Black" "Black" "Red"   "Red"   "White" "White" "White"
 [91] "White" "Red"   "Red"   "Red"   "White" "Black" "White" "Black" "Black"
[100] "White"
# seems a bit nicer
```
6. Use the as.is argument to import colors of cars as strings and names of states as factors.
```

> carSpeeds <- read.csv(file='./car-speeds.csv', as.is=1)
> carSpeeds$Color <- ifelse(carSpeeds$Color=='Blue', 'Green', carSpeeds$Color)
> carSpeeds$Color
  [1] "Green" " Red"  "Green" "White" "Red"   "Green" "Green" "Black" "White"
 [10] "Red"   "Red"   "White" "Green" "Green" "Black" "Red"   "Green" "Green"
 [19] "White" "Green" "Green" "Green" "Red"   "Green" "Red"   "Red"   "Red"
 [28] "Red"   "White" "Green" "Red"   "White" "Black" "Red"   "Black" "Black"
 [37] "Green" "Red"   "Black" "Red"   "Black" "Black" "Red"   "Red"   "White"
 [46] "Black" "Green" "Red"   "Red"   "Black" "Black" "Red"   "White" "Red"
 [55] "Green" "Green" "Black" "Green" "White" "Black" "Red"   "Green" "Green"
 [64] "White" "Black" "Red"   "Red"   "Black" "Green" "White" "Green" "Red"
 [73] "White" "White" "Green" "Green" "Green" "Green" "Green" "White" "Black"
 [82] "Green" "White" "Black" "Black" "Red"   "Red"   "White" "White" "White"
 [91] "White" "Red"   "Red"   "Red"   "White" "Black" "White" "Black" "Black"
[100] "White"
> carSpeeds$State <- ifelse(carSpeeds$State=='Arizona', 'Ohio', carSpeeds$State)
> carSpeeds$State
  [1] "3"    "Ohio" "2"    "Ohio" "Ohio" "Ohio" "3"    "2"    "Ohio" "2"
 [11] "4"    "4"    "4"    "4"    "4"    "3"    "Ohio" "3"    "Ohio" "4"
 [21] "4"    "4"    "3"    "2"    "2"    "3"    "2"    "4"    "2"    "4"

 [91] "4"    "Ohio" "Ohio" "3"    "2"    "2"    "4"    "3"    "Ohio" "4"

> carSpeeds <- read.csv(file='./car-speeds.csv', as.is=1)
> carSpeeds$Color <- ifelse(carSpeeds$Color=='Blue', 'Green', carSpeeds$Color)
> carSpeeds$Color
  [1] "Green" " Red"  "Green" "White" "Red"   "Green" "Green" "Black" "White"
 [10] "Red"   "Red"   "White" "Green" "Green" "Black" "Red"   "Green" "Green"
 [19] "White" "Green" "Green" "Green" "Red"   "Green" "Red"   "Red"   "Red"
 [28] "Red"   "White" "Green" "Red"   "White" "Black" "Red"   "Black" "Black"
 [37] "Green" "Red"   "Black" "Red"   "Black" "Black" "Red"   "Red"   "White"

 [91] "White" "Red"   "Red"   "Red"   "White" "Black" "White" "Black" "Black"
[100] "White"
```

7. Check for unique values in the $Color column of the dataset to see if there are any whitespaces. Use unique function
```
> unique(carSpeeds$Color)
[1] "3"    "Ohio" "2"    "4"
```

8. Import dataset using the `strip.white` argument, then check again $Color cloumn for uniqness.
```
> carSpeeds <- read.csv(file='./car-speeds.csv', stringsAsFactors=FALSE, strip.white=TRUE,sep=',')
> head(carSpeeds)
  Color Speed     State
1  Blue    32 NewMexico
2   Red    45   Arizona
3  Blue    35  Colorado
4 White    34   Arizona
5   Red    25   Arizona
6  Blue    41   Arizona
```

9. Export the dataset with replaced 'Blue' and 'Green' in the $Color column by using `write.csv`.
```
write.csv(carSpeeds, file=``)
```

10. Correct the output file by setting row.names argument to false.
11. Replace the speed in the 3rd row of CarSpeeds with NA value by using index. Then write new csv file with NA replaced by -9999

## Part 2 - vectorized operations
1. Create two vectors: `a` and `b` with values `1:10` and then add pairs of numbers contained in this two vectors
2. Create a vector `c` with `1:5` values, then add this vector to vector a.
3. Multiply every element of vector by 5
4. Try to add vector a and e. Notice that this time the length of the longer object is not a multiple of the shorter object length.

# Part 3 - Subsetting data
1. Create a vector animal as in the example below. Then subset this vector with first three and then last three characters.
2. Answer the questions:
  - If the first four characters are selected using the slice animal[1:4] how can we obtain the first for characters in reverse order?
  - What is `animal[-1]`? What is `animal[-1]`? Given those answers, explain what `animal[-1:-4]` does.
  - Use a slice of animal to create new character vector that spells the word "eon", i.e. `c("e", "o", "n")`.
3. Donwload, extract and then read the .csv file into "dat" variable from file inflammation-01.csv.zip
4. Check what type and shape of thing "dat" is (use `class()` and `dim()` functions).
5. Pick column 10 and 20 from rows 1, 3, 5.
6. Select the first 10 columns of values for the first four rows.
7. Select the first 10 columns of rows 5 to 10
8. Select all rows from column 16-18.
9. Check the maximum inflammation value for patient 1 and patient 2. Then check the minimum inflammation on day 7.

# Part 4 - Control structures
1. Analyze how this `for loop` works:
2. Analyze how this `while loop` works:
3. Analyze how below repeat loop works. Pay attention to the `if-else`, `next` and `break` structures.

# Part 5 - Exercise
1. Suppose you want to determine the maximum inflammation for patient 5 across days three to seven. To do this you would extract the relevant subset from the data frame and calculate the maximum value. Which of the following lines of R code gives the correct answer?
  - `max(dat[5,])`
  - `max(dat[3:7, 5])`
  - `max(dat[5, 3:7])`
  - `max(dat[5, 3, 7])`
2. Using the inflammation data frame "dat" from above: Let's pretend there was somethig wrong with the instrument on the first five days for every second patient (#2, 4, 6, etc.), which resulted in the measurements being twice as large as they should be.
  - Write a vector containing each affected patient (hint: ? seq)
  - Create a new data frame with in which you halve the first five days' values in only those patients
  - Print out the corrected data frame to check that your code has fixed the problem
